# Modeling_of_Robotic_Agent_using_Colored_Petri_Net

Discrete event systems course, taken during my masters, introduced Colored Petri Nets (CPN). To demonstrate the understanding of the CPN, we used CPN to model and analyze the behavior of a robotic agent in Robot Soccer. A hypothetical robotic agent was assumed to track the ball and walk to it to kick the ball towards the goal post. While walking towards the ball or kicking the ball towards the goal, the robotic agent avoids the obstacles, if it comes across any. A CPN was developed to model the aforementioned robotic agent behavior.

Data corresponding to the robotic agent and the soccer ball was collected; It was imported to an Excel sheet for further processing and visualization. The processed data was visualized as a bubble chart using the Power View tool in Excel for a better understanding of the robotic agent behavior.
